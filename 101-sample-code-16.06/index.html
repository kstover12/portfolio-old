              <p>I played Volleyball and studied Economics at Santa Clara
                University (go broncos!). After graduating I worked in
                Sales/Marketing before transitioning to running a tech startup.
                Once I entered the startup world, I couldn't get enough and
                decided to make a career out of it, so I trained as a Full
                Stack Web Developer with a focus on UI/UX design.
                And the rest is history!</p>

              <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build
                 on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I
                 make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.
